## Problem Statement:

This was the question, as we can see this seems to be a morse code,a morse code is a cipher in which the letters of the alphabet are coded as a combination of dots and dashes We can clearly see here we got a morse code we copy this morse code and go to google and search for morse decoder, then we paste our morse code there as soon as we paste the morse code we will get our flag as

Now in hints its written there add curly brackets to the flag and the flag is in lower case so
cvctf{mor53isn0t50fun} this will be our final flag. 

### FLAG: cvctf{mor53isn0t50fun} 

Note:If you dont get directly answer by decoding it try replacing all - by 1 and . by 0 so it can form
binary, then decode that binary.
